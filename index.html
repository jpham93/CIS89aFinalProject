<!--
    Project Rubric to keep in mind:

    CSS - attributes, application, code formatting (check)
    head, body, meta, title, comments (check)
    text, links - font, size, color (check)
    images - alt    (check)
    media - display, play (check)
    lists, table (check)
    form (check, used in the form of email submission)
    excellence - design, usability, originality (left for users to judge)

    Note:
    I used a lot of different classes and id's in anticpation of formatting. However,
    a lot of them ended up unused, but regardless, I retained them as a way to show how
    I was dividing up my content.

    My main focus, after ensuring that I included all basic concepts from this course, was
    to have the best responsive design to my ability. This had some concepts beyond the 
    regular course material, but I hope that it does not intefere with the general content of
    my project. Enjoy!
