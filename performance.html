                <p>
                    The one prescription that we tend to neglect is exercise. Exercise 
                    is key to longevity, because it supports and maintains many of our physiological needs.
                    Exercise helps prevent a myriad of diseases including the number one killer in the United States, heart 
                    disease. By subscribing to a consistent exercise routine, we can avoid early mortality 
                    or even a heavy price tag associated with healthcare.

                        This bar graph demonstrates the relative risk for of death of each fitness category where 1 represents least fit and 5 
                        represents most fit. <i>Graph provided by <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/107/1/e2">American Heart Assocication</a></i>

                    Physical activity is perhaps one of the best preventative solutions to heart disease. General benefits that adults experience with consistent exercise
                    is reduced body fat, reduced blood pressure, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or better known as bad cholesterol), increased high-density
                    lipoprotein (HDL or good cholesterol), and increased insulin sensitivity. Overall, exercise is good for general health and preventing early mortality as 
                    exemplified by the graph above.

                        The following graph shows how bone density dramatically decreases after a critical point in life. This can be prevented with an exercise program.

                <p>
                    As we age, our bone density begins to deteriorate and cause osteoporosis, especially in women post menopause. Exercise, particularly resistance training,
                    helps increasing bone density. As a first line of defense, many of us should consider exercise the primary solution.

                        This study shows patients who were given exercise, medication, and a combination of the two to treat depression. Exercise alone shows the highest 
                        recovery rate with the lowest relapse rate. <i>Graph provided by <a href="http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH/Exercise/Exercise_print.html">Boston University</a></i>

                    One of the best tools for fighting depression is exercise! 1 out of 10 Americans suffer an episode of depression anually, and a lot of Americans
                    are guided to a pharmaceutical approach for treatment. As shown in the graph above, exercise appears to be a better solution to depression than the often prescribed
                    antidepressants. No one should rule any type of treatments of course, but maybe we should start putting more emphasis on exercise as a viable alternative to
                    the conventional pharmacological approach.
