                <p>
                   Exercise alone is not enough to maximize longevity. Like peanut butter is to jam, exercise is a complement to your dietary
                   choices. By paying attention to both diet and exercise, one can achieve ultimate balance in health and wellness.
                   Although there are a lot of different diet variations, your choices are dependent on your own individual needs.

                <p>
                    We won't be going over too much about macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbohydrates) as people vary
                    a lot in this area of nutrition. Some people need more protein. Others need to be wary of certain types of 
                    fats or carbohydrates if they are prone to disease. The general rule is avoid processed foods, and eat everything
                    homemade as much as possible

                <p>
                    Micronutrients considers the less essential (although still very important) nutrients. Our micronutrient consumption
                    is usually satisfied by our normal food. However, We'll go over some micronutrients that I find would be a delightful discovery for our audience.

                    <b>Vitamin B-12</b> - Recently, there has been a large advertisement value for food and supplement goods with Vitamin B-12.
                    Vitamin B-12 is responsible for healthy nerve and blood cells. A lack of Vitamin B-12 causes fatigue, breathlessness, and other
                    negative symptoms. You can find Vitamin B-12 in eggs, meat, dairy, or in supplmental forms like Vitamin B complex or Vitamin 
                    B-12 extracts.

                    <b>Ginger</b> - Although not high in vitamins and minerals, ginger has a unique property that reduces inflammation in the body.
                    Many people use it as a home ready for stomach aches, nausea, and soreness.

                    <b>Curcumin</b> - Found in turmeric and used in many rich cooking, curcumin packs a denser nutrition label than ginger. It also
                    contains powerful anti-inflammatory components and is also a strong antioxidant. A serving of turmeric also contains a decent amount 
                    of other vitamins and minerals including iron and potassium, so if you plan to get curcumin through turmeric, you'll be receiving
                    a nice deal!
